# Health-insurance-transgender
Replication files for *Health insurance coverage and health outcomes among transgender adults in the U.S.*. 

The "Master.do" do-file reports each step of the analysis. The anlysis was carried out on Stata 16. 

All of the source data used in the analysis is publically availible. The Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System datasets are too large to upload to github, but can be downloaded [here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm).
